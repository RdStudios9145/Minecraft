# Minecraft

Hello

I open sourced this now

Build with webpack or play [here](https://minecraft.rdstudios.repl.co)

## How to build

1. Install the repo on your computer with ```git https://github.com/RdStudios9145/Minecraft.git```
2. Install the node modules required with ```npm i``` or ```npm install```
3. Build the `bundle.js` with `npx webpack` (`npx webpack --watch` is recomended if you are developing)
4. Host the files
	- The VSCode extension 'Live Server' is recommended for this step, but not required
	- Image URLs will not work if you open the `index.html` file directly on your browser

## How you can help

If you know about physics, I would like assistance with the physics engine

You can also just, like, submit prs or issues

## Stuff I'll probably add

1. Multiplayer
1. World saves
1. Good physics
